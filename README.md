Hi ,

Here is my little React project :

It references all the countries of the world,their capital city, their flag, their currency and the population.

On this project you can:

- filter countries by continent
- increase or decrease the number of countries

Coming soon :

You will be able to share your exeperiences on different countries
Responsive on mobile

To run the project :
